# PyRes - Reservoir Simulation and Optimization Tool

PyRes is a Python application designed to automate reservoir simulation using the Computer Modeling Group (CMG) software in the background. The primary objective is to optimize parameters in a model template to increase the Net Present Value (NPV) in a numerical oil production scenario. Additionally, PyRes includes the Engineered Water Salinity module, which utilizes machine learning to predict the relative permeability curve of the model based on salinity input.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- CMG Software: Ensure that you have the required CMG software installed on your system (GEM for compositional modes, IMEX for black-oil).
- Python: PyRes is a Python application, so make sure you have Python installed (version >= 3.6.0).

### Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/PyRes.git
cd PyRes
```
### Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage

#### Reservoir Numerical File (.dat): 
- Prepare a reservoir numerical file following CMG standards (.dat).
- Replace optimization variables in the template with keywords.

#### Configuration Files:
Configure the following YAML and CSV files located in **src/config/**
- **economics.yaml**: NPV calculation parameters (oil price, cost, tax rate, etc.).
- **investments.csv**: Investments over simulation years (exploration, formation evaluation, wells construction, facility, abandonment).
- **optmization_vars.yaml**: Optimization constraints (type, optimizer engine, keywords, range).
- **pso_setup.yaml**: Particle Swarm Optimization settings (kappa, phi, iterations, population, etc.).
- **simulation.yaml**: CMG back-end execution details (path for .exe files, report settings, simulation template path, etc.).

### Run PyRes
```bash
python main.py
```
